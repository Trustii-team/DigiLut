## DigiLut Challenge - code for training

### Getting Started
The code is divided into two folders:
```training``` and ```training_data_preprocessing```.
This code does not contain the code for the prediction process on validation images, which is available in the final submission zip file. The ```training/src/models/binary_model.py``` file corresponds to the source code of the model provided during the final submission.

1. Read the README in the ```training_data_preprocessing``` folder and follow its steps. This part was run on the Trustii Jupyter Hub.
2. Read the README in the ```training``` folder and follow its steps. This part was run on a high performance cluster (One A100 GPU)
